Default value: ssl-forward-proxy

##### `description`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Provide a description of the service.

##### `tags`

Data type: `Optional[Array[String]]`

A policy tag is a keyword or phrase that allows you to sort or filter policies. This is useful when you have defined many policies and want to
view those that are tagged with a particular keyword.For example, you may want to tag certain rules with specific words like Decrypt and No-decrypt,
or use the name of a specific data center for policies associated with that location.

##### `source_zones`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Zones must be of the same type (Layer 2, Layer 3, or virtual wire).

Multiple zones can be used to simplify management. For example, if you have three different internal zones (Marketing, Sales, and Public Relations)
that are all directed to the untrusted destination zone, you can create one rule that covers all cases.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `source_address`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The list of source addresses, address groups, or regions

Default value: ["any"]

##### `negate_source`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Matches on the reverse of the `source_address` value.

##### `source_users`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The following source values are supported:

* ['any']: Include any traffic regardless of user data.

* ['pre-logon']: Include remote users that are connected to the network using GlobalProtect, but are not logged into their system.
When the Pre-logon option is configured on the Portal for GlobalProtect clients, any user who is not currently logged into their machine
will be identified with the username pre-logon. You can then create policies for pre-logon users and although the user is not logged in directly,
their machines are authenticated on the domain as if they were fully logged in.

* ['known-user']: Includes all authenticated users, which means any IP with user data mapped. This option is equivalent to the domain users group on a domain.

* ['unknown']: Includes all unauthenticated users, which means IP addresses that are not mapped to a user. For example, you could use unknown for guest
level access to something because they will have an IP on your network but will not be authenticated to the domain and will not have IP
to user mapping information on the firewall.

* Or provide a list of specific users. E.g. ['admin','john.doe','jane.doe']

Note: If you are using a RADIUS server and not the User-ID agent, the list of users does not display; you must enter user information manually.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `destination_zones`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify one or more destination zones. Zones must be of the same type (Layer 2, Layer 3, or virtual wire). To define new zones, refer to “Defining Security Zones”.
Multiple zones can be used to simplify management. For example, if you have three different internal zones (Marketing, Sales, and Public Relations) that are all
directed to the untrusted destination zone, you can create one rule that covers all cases.

Note: On intrazone rules, you cannot define a Destination Zone because these types of rules only match traffic with a source and a destination within the same zone.
To specify the zones that match an intrazone rule you only need to set the Source Zone.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `destination_address`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify one or more destination addresses, address groups or regions

Default value: ["any"]

##### `negate_destination`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Matches on the reverse of the `destination_address` value.

##### `services`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Select services to limit to specific TCP and/or UDP port numbers. The following values are valid:

* ['any']: The selected applications are allowed or denied on any protocol or port.

* ['application-default']: The selected applications are allowed or denied only on their default ports defined by Palo Alto Networks®.
This option is recommended for allow policies because it prevents applications from running on unusual ports and protocol which, if not
intentional, can be a sign of undesired application behavior and usage.

Note that when you use this option, the firewall still checks for all applications on all ports but, with this configuration, applications are only allowed on their default ports and protocols.

* A list of services. E.g. ['service-http', 'service-https', 'my_custom_service']

Default value: ["application-default"]

##### `categories`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The destination URL categories. The following values are valid:

* ['any']: Allow or deny all sessions regardless of the URL category.

* A list of specific categories or custom categories. E.g ['gambling','malware','my_custom_category']

Default value: ["any"]

##### `action`

Data type: `Enum["decrypt", "no-decrypt"]`

To specify the action for traffic that matches the attributes defined in a rule, select from the following actions:

* no-ecrypt: Do not decrypt the traffic.

* decrypt: Decrypt the traffic.

Default value: no-decrypt

##### `profile`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Specify the decryption profile, can only be set when `action` is `decrypt`.

##### `disable`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify if the security policy rule should be disabled.

##### `insert_after`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Specifies where the rule should be inserted.

* If specified with an empty string, the rule will be inserted at the TOP.
  NOTE: Only one rule should be set to top
* If a rule name is specified, the rule will be inserted after the given rule.
* If this attribute is omitted, the rule will be added at the bottom.
  NOTE: Rules cannot be moved to the bottom once created. Instead specify the rule name to insert after.

#### Parameters

This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage IPv6 Path Monitors on Palo Alto devices.

* **Note** Can only be configured on PAN-OS 8.1.0 devices.

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `panos_ipv6_path_monitor` type.

##### `ensure`

Data type: `Enum[present, absent]`

Whether this resource should be present or absent on the target system.

Default value: present

##### `source`

Data type: `String`

Specify the IP address that the firewall will use as the source in the ICMP ping to the monitored destination:

  * If the interface has multiple IP addresses, select one.
  * If you specify an interface, the firewall uses the first IP address assigned to the interface by default.
  * If you specify `DHCP` (Use DHCP Client address), the firewall uses the address that DHCP assigned to the interface. To see the DHCP address, select NetworkInterfacesEthernet and in the row for the Ethernet interface, click on Dynamic DHCP Client. The IP Address appears in the Dynamic IP Interface Status window.

##### `destination`

Data type: `String`

Specify a robust, stable IP address or address object for which the firewall will monitor the path. The monitored destination and the static route destination must use the same address family (IPv4 or IPv6)

##### `interval`

Data type: `String`

Specify the ICMP ping interval in seconds to determine how frequently the firewall monitors the path (pings the monitored destination; range is 1-60; default is 3).

Default value: 3

##### `count`

Data type: `String`

Specify the number of consecutive ICMP ping packets that do not return from the monitored destination before the firewall considers the link down. Based on the Any or All failure condition, if path monitoring is in failed state, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB (range is 3-10; default is 5).

For example, a Ping Interval of 3 seconds and Ping Count of 5 missed pings (the firewall receives no ping in the last 15 seconds) means path monitoring detects a link failure. If path monitoring is in failed state and the firewall receives a ping after 15 seconds, the link is deemed up; based on the Any or All failure condition, path monitoring to Any or All monitored destinations can be deemed up, and the Preemptive Hold Time starts.

Default value: 5

##### `enable`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Select to enable path monitoring of this specific destination for the static route; the firewall sends ICMP pings to this destination.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `panos_ipv6_path_monitor` type.

  * ipv6-address: Select to enter the IP address of the next hop router.
  * next-vr: Select to select a virtual router in the firewall as the next hop. This allows you to route internally between virtual routers within a single firewall.
  * discard: Select if you want to drop traffic that is addressed to this destination.
  * none: Select if there is no next hop for the route.

##### `bfd_profile`

Data type: `String`

PA-7000 Series, or VM-Series firewall, specify one of the following:

  * `default`: a BFD profile that you have created on the firewall
  * `None`: to disable BFD for the static route.

To use BFD on a static route:

  * Both the firewall and the peer at the opposite end of the static route must support BFD sessions.
  * The static route nexthop_type must be `ip-address` and you must enter a valid IP address in `nexthop`.
  * The `interface` attribute cannot be `none`; you must specify an interface (even if you are using a DHCP address).

Default value: None

Enter an IP address and network mask in Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) notation: ip_address/mask (for example, 192.168.2.0/24 for IPv4 or 2001:db8::/32 for IPv6).

##### `no_install`

Data type: `Boolean`

Select if you do not want to install the route in the forwarding table. The route is retained in the configuration for future reference. Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 7.1.0.

##### `route_type`

Data type: `Optional[Enum["unicast", "multicast", "both", "no-install"]]`

Specify the route table into which the firewall installs the static route:

  * `unicast`: Installs the route into the unicast route table.
  * `multicast`: Installs the route into the multicast route table.
  * `both`: Installs the route into the unicast and multicast route tables.
  * `no-install`: Does not install the route in the route table (RIB); the firewall retains the static route for future reference until you delete the route.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `path_monitoring`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify true to enable path monitoring for the static route.

Note: must be enabled if using `panos_ipv6_monitor_destinations` for the static route.

##### `failure_condition`

Data type: `Optional[Enum["any", "all"]]`

Specify the condition under which the firewall considers the monitored path down and thus the static route down:

  * `any`: If any one of the monitored destinations for the static route is unreachable by ICMP, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB and FIB and adds the dynamic or static route that has the next lowest metric going to the same destination to the FIB.
  * `all`: If all of the monitored destinations for the static route are unreachable by ICMP, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB and FIB and adds the dynamic or static route that has the next lowest metric going to the same destination to the FIB.

Specify `all` to avoid the possibility of a single monitored destination signaling a static route failure when that monitored destination is simply offline for maintenance, for example.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `enable`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify true to enable path monitoring of this specific destination for the static route; the firewall sends ICMP pings to this destination.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `hold_time`

Data type: `Optional[Variant[String, Integer[0, 1440]]]`

Specify the number of minutes a downed path monitor must remain in Up stat:the path monitor evaluates all of its member monitored destinations and must remain Up before the firewall reinstalls the static route into the RIB. If the timer expires without the link going down or flapping, the link is deemed stable, path monitor can remain Up, and the firewall can add the static route back into the RIB.

If the link goes down or flaps during the hold time, path monitor fails and the timer restarts when the downed monitor returns to Up state. A Preemptive Hold Time of zero causes the firewall to reinstall the static route into the RIB immediately upon the path monitor coming up. Range is 0-1,440; default is 2.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

You can specify multiple zones to simplify management. For example, you can configure settings so that multiple internal NAT addresses are directed to the same external IP address.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `to`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify one or more destinations zones for the original (non-NAT) packet. Zones must be of the same type (Layer 2, Layer 3, or virtual wire).
You can specify multiple zones to simplify management. For example, you can configure settings so that multiple internal NAT addresses are directed to the same external IP address.

##### `destination_interface`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Specify the destination interface of packets the firewall translates.
You can use the destination interface to translate IP addresses differently in the case where the network is connected to two ISPs with different IP address pools

##### `service`

Data type: `String`

Specify the service for which the firewall translates the source or destination address.

Default value: any

##### `source`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify a combination of source addresses for the firewall to translate.
For NPTv6, the prefixes configured for Source Address and Destination Address must be in the format xxxx:xxxx::/yy.
The address cannot have an interface identifier (host) portion defined. The range of supported prefix lengths is /32 to /64.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `destination`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify a combination of destination addresses for the firewall to translate.
For NPTv6, the prefixes configured for Source Address and Destination Address must be in the format xxxx:xxxx::/yy.
The address cannot have an interface identifier (host) portion defined. The range of supported prefix lengths is /32 to /64.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `source_translation_type`

Data type: `Optional[Enum["dynamic-ip", "static-ip", "dynamic-ip-and-port", "none"]]`

The size of the address range is limited by the type of address pool:

* dynamic-ip-and-port: Address selection is based on a hash of the source IP address.
  For a given source IP address, the firewall will use the same translated source address for all sessions.
  Dynamic IP and Port source NAT supports approximately 64k concurrent sessions on each IP address in the NAT pool.
  On some platforms, over-subscription is supported, which will allow a single IP to host more than 64k concurrent sessions.
  Palo Alto Networks Dynamic IP/port NAT supports more NAT sessions than are supported by the number of available IP addresses and ports.
  The firewall can use IP address and port combinations up to two times (simultaneously) on the PA-200, PA-500, PA-2000 Series and PA-3000 Series firewalls,
  four times on the PA-4020 and PA-5020 firewalls, and eight times on the PA‑4050, PA-4060, PA-5050, and PA-5060 firewalls when destination IP addresses are unique.

* dynamic-ip: The next available address in the specified range is used, but the port number is unchanged. Up to 32k consecutive IP addresses are supported.
  A dynamic IP pool can contain multiple subnets, so you can translate your internal network addresses to two or more separate public subnets.
    * Advanced (Fall back Dynamic IP Translation)—Use this option to create a fall back pool that will perform IP and port translation and will be used if the primary pool runs out of addresses.
      You can define addresses for the pool by using the Translated Address option or the Interface Address option, which is for interfaces that receive an IP address dynamically.
      When creating a fall back pool, make sure addresses do not overlap with addresses in the primary pool.

* static-ip: The same address is always used for the translation and the port is unchanged.
  For example, if the source range is 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.10 and the translation range is 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.10, address 192.168.0.2 is always translated to 10.0.0.2. The address range is virtually unlimited.
    * NPTv6 must use Static IP translation for Source Address Translation. For NPTv6, the prefixes configured for Translated Address must be in the format xxxx:xxxx::/yy.
      The address cannot have an interface identifier (host) portion defined. The range of supported prefix lengths is /32 to /64.

* None: Translation is not performed.

##### `bi_directional`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Enable bidirectional translation if you want the firewall to create a corresponding translation (NAT or NPTv6) in the opposite direction of the translation you configure.
Note: If you enable bidirectional translation, you must ensure that you have security policies in place to control the traffic in both directions. Without such policies,
the bidirectional feature allows packets to be translated automatically in both directions.

##### `destination_translated_address`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

The address to which the packets are translated.

For NPTv6, the prefixes configured for Destination prefix Translated Address must be in the format xxxx:xxxx::/yy.
The address cannot have an interface identifier (host) portion defined. The range of supported prefix lengths is /32 to /64.

##### `destination_translated_port`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

The port of the translated address

Note that Translated Port is not supported for NPTv6 because NPTv6 is strictly prefix translation. The Port and Host address section is simply forwarded unchanged.

* If specified with an empty string, the rule will be inserted at the TOP.
  NOTE: Only one rule should be set to top
* If a rule name is specified, the rule will be inserted after the given rule.
* If this attribute is omitted, the rule will be added at the bottom.
  NOTE: Rules cannot be moved to the bottom once created. Instead specify the rule name to insert after.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `panos_nat_policy` type.

##### `name`

namevar

Data type: `Pattern[/^[a-zA-z0-9\-_\s\.]{1,63}$/]`
_*this data type contains a regex that may not be accurately reflected in generated documentation_

The display-name of the zone. Restricted to 31 characters on PAN-OS version 7.1.0.

### panos_path_monitor

This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage IPv4 Path Monitors on Palo Alto devices.

* **Note** Can only be configured on PAN-OS 8.1.0 devices.

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `panos_path_monitor` type.

##### `ensure`

Data type: `Enum[present, absent]`

Whether this resource should be present or absent on the target system.

Default value: present

##### `source`

Data type: `String`

Specify the IP address that the firewall will use as the source in the ICMP ping to the monitored destination:

  * If the interface has multiple IP addresses, select one.
  * If you specify an interface, the firewall uses the first IP address assigned to the interface by default.
  * If you specify `DHCP` (Use DHCP Client address), the firewall uses the address that DHCP assigned to the interface. To see the DHCP address, select NetworkInterfacesEthernet and in the row for the Ethernet interface, click on Dynamic DHCP Client. The IP Address appears in the Dynamic IP Interface Status window.

##### `destination`

Data type: `String`

Specify a robust, stable IP address or address object for which the firewall will monitor the path. The monitored destination and the static route destination must use the same address family (IPv4 or IPv6)

##### `interval`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Specify the ICMP ping interval in seconds to determine how frequently the firewall monitors the path (pings the monitored destination; range is 1-60; default is 3).

Default value: 3

##### `count`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Specify the number of consecutive ICMP ping packets that do not return from the monitored destination before the firewall considers the link down. Based on the Any or All failure condition, if path monitoring is in failed state, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB (range is 3-10; default is 5).

For example, a Ping Interval of 3 seconds and Ping Count of 5 missed pings (the firewall receives no ping in the last 15 seconds) means path monitoring detects a link failure. If path monitoring is in failed state and the firewall receives a ping after 15 seconds, the link is deemed up; based on the Any or All failure condition, path monitoring to Any or All monitored destinations can be deemed up, and the Preemptive Hold Time starts.

Default value: 5

##### `enable`

all traffic within zone A, all traffic within zone B, and all traffic from zone A to zone B and all traffic from zone B to zone A.

* intrazone: Applies the rule to all matching traffic within the specified source zones (you cannot specify a destination zone for
intrazone rules). For example, if you set the source zone to A and B, the rule would apply to all traffic within zone A and all
traffic within zone B, but not to traffic between zones A and B.

* interzone: Applies the rule to all matching traffic between the specified source and destination zones. For example, if you set
the source zone to A, B, and C and the destination zone to A and B, the rule would apply to traffic from zone A to zone B, from zone B
to zone A, from zone C to zone A, and from zone C to zone B, but not traffic within zones A, B, or C.

Default value: universal

##### `description`

Data type: `Optional[String]`

Provide a description of the service.

##### `tags`

Data type: `Optional[Array[String]]`

A policy tag is a keyword or phrase that allows you to sort or filter policies. This is useful when you have defined many policies and want to
view those that are tagged with a particular keyword.For example, you may want to tag certain rules with specific words like Decrypt and No-decrypt,
or use the name of a specific data center for policies associated with that location.

##### `source_zones`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Zones must be of the same type (Layer 2, Layer 3, or virtual wire).

Multiple zones can be used to simplify management. For example, if you have three different internal zones (Marketing, Sales, and Public Relations)
that are all directed to the untrusted destination zone, you can create one rule that covers all cases.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `source_address`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The list of source addresses, address groups, or regions

Default value: ["any"]

##### `negate_source`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Matches on the reverse of the `source_address` value.

##### `source_users`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The following source values are supported:

* ['any']: Include any traffic regardless of user data.

* ['pre-logon']: Include remote users that are connected to the network using GlobalProtect, but are not logged into their system.
When the Pre-logon option is configured on the Portal for GlobalProtect clients, any user who is not currently logged into their machine
will be identified with the username pre-logon. You can then create policies for pre-logon users and although the user is not logged in directly,
their machines are authenticated on the domain as if they were fully logged in.

* ['known-user']: Includes all authenticated users, which means any IP with user data mapped. This option is equivalent to the domain users group on a domain.

* ['unknown']: Includes all unauthenticated users, which means IP addresses that are not mapped to a user. For example, you could use unknown for guest
level access to something because they will have an IP on your network but will not be authenticated to the domain and will not have IP
to user mapping information on the firewall.

* Or provide a list of specific users. E.g. ['admin','john.doe','jane.doe']

Note: If you are using a RADIUS server and not the User-ID agent, the list of users does not display; you must enter user information manually.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `hip_profiles`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specifiy one or more HIP profiles. A HIP enables you to collect information about the security status of your end hosts, such as whether they have the latest
security patches and antivirus definitions installed. Using host information profiles for policy enforcement enables granular security that ensures that the
remote hosts accessing your critical resources are adequately maintained and in adherence with your security standards before they are allowed access to your
network resources.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `destination_zones`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify one or more destination zones. Zones must be of the same type (Layer 2, Layer 3, or virtual wire). To define new zones, refer to “Defining Security Zones”.
Multiple zones can be used to simplify management. For example, if you have three different internal zones (Marketing, Sales, and Public Relations) that are all
directed to the untrusted destination zone, you can create one rule that covers all cases.

Note: On intrazone rules, you cannot define a Destination Zone because these types of rules only match traffic with a source and a destination within the same zone.
To specify the zones that match an intrazone rule you only need to set the Source Zone.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `destination_address`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Specify one or more destination addresses, address groups or regions

Default value: ["any"]

##### `negate_destination`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Matches on the reverse of the `destination_address` value.

##### `applications`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Select specific applications for the security rule. If an application has multiple functions, you can select the overall application or individual functions.
If you select the overall application, all functions are included and the application definition is automatically updated as future functions are added.

Default value: ["any"]

##### `services`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Select services to limit to specific TCP and/or UDP port numbers. The following values are valid:

* ['any']: The selected applications are allowed or denied on any protocol or port.

* ['application-default']: The selected applications are allowed or denied only on their default ports defined by Palo Alto Networks®.
This option is recommended for allow policies because it prevents applications from running on unusual ports and protocol which, if not
intentional, can be a sign of undesired application behavior and usage.

Note that when you use this option, the firewall still checks for all applications on all ports but, with this configuration, applications are only allowed on their default ports and protocols.

* A list of services. E.g. ['service-http', 'service-https', 'my_custom_service']

Default value: ["application-default"]

##### `categories`

Data type: `Array[String]`

The destination URL categories. The following values are valid:

* ['any']: Allow or deny all sessions regardless of the URL category.

* A list of specific categories or custom categories. E.g ['gambling','malware','my_custom_category']

Default value: ["any"]

##### `action`

Data type: `Enum["deny", "allow", "drop", "reset-client", "reset-server", "reset-both"]`

To specify the action for traffic that matches the attributes defined in a rule, select from the following actions:

* allow: Allows the traffic.

* deny: Blocks traffic, and enforces the default Deny Action defined for the application that is being denied. To view the deny action defined by default for an application,
view the application details in Objects > Applications. Because the default deny action varies by application, the firewall could block the session and send a reset for one
application, while it could drop the session silently for another application.

* drop: Silently drops the application. A TCP reset is not sent to the host/application, unless `ICMP Unreachable` is set to true.

* reset-client: Sends a TCP reset to the client-side device.

* reset-server: Sends a TCP reset to the server-side device.

* reset-both: Sends a TCP reset to both the client-side and server-side devices.

Default value: allow

##### `icmp_unreachable`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Only available for Layer 3 interfaces. When you configure security policy to drop traffic or to reset the connection, the traffic does not reach the destination host.
In such cases, for all UDP traffic and for TCP traffic that is dropped, you can enable the firewall to send an ICMP Unreachable response to the source IP address from
where the traffic originated. Enabling this setting allows the source to gracefully close or clear the session and prevents applications from breaking.

##### `log_start`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Generates a traffic log entry for the start of a session 

##### `log_end`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Generates a traffic log entry for the end of a session

Default value: true

##### `log_setting`

Enter an IP address and network mask in Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) notation: ip_address/mask (for example, 192.168.2.0/24 for IPv4 or 2001:db8::/32 for IPv6).

##### `no_install`

Data type: `Boolean`

Select if you do not want to install the route in the forwarding table. The route is retained in the configuration for future reference. Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 7.1.0.

##### `route_type`

Data type: `Optional[Enum["unicast", "multicast", "both", "no-install"]]`

Specify the route table into which the firewall installs the static route:

  * `unicast`: Installs the route into the unicast route table.
  * `multicast`: Installs the route into the multicast route table.
  * `both`: Installs the route into the unicast and multicast route tables.
  * `no-install`: Does not install the route in the route table (RIB); the firewall retains the static route for future reference until you delete the route.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `path_monitoring`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify true to enable path monitoring for the static route.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.
Note: must be enabled if using `panos_monitor_destinations` for the static route.

##### `failure_condition`

Data type: `Optional[Enum["any", "all"]]`

Specify the condition under which the firewall considers the monitored path down and thus the static route down:

  * `any`: If any one of the monitored destinations for the static route is unreachable by ICMP, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB and FIB and adds the dynamic or static route that has the next lowest metric going to the same destination to the FIB.
  * `all`: If all of the monitored destinations for the static route are unreachable by ICMP, the firewall removes the static route from the RIB and FIB and adds the dynamic or static route that has the next lowest metric going to the same destination to the FIB.

Specify `all` to avoid the possibility of a single monitored destination signaling a static route failure when that monitored destination is simply offline for maintenance, for example.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `enable`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify true to enable path monitoring of this specific destination for the static route; the firewall sends ICMP pings to this destination.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `hold_time`

Data type: `Optional[Variant[String, Integer[0, 1440]]]`

Specify the number of minutes a downed path monitor must remain in Up stat:the path monitor evaluates all of its member monitored destinations and must remain Up before the firewall reinstalls the static route into the RIB. If the timer expires without the link going down or flapping, the link is deemed stable, path monitor can remain Up, and the firewall can add the static route back into the RIB.

If the link goes down or flaps during the hold time, path monitor fails and the timer restarts when the downed monitor returns to Up state. A Preemptive Hold Time of zero causes the firewall to reinstall the static route into the RIB immediately upon the path monitor coming up. Range is 0-1,440; default is 2.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

Specify a log forwarding profile for forwarding zone protection logs to an external system

##### `enable_user_identification`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

If you configured User-ID™ to perform IP address-to-username mapping (discovery), select this option to apply the mapping information to traffic in this zone.
If you disable this option, firewall logs, reports, and policies will exclude user mapping information for traffic within the zone.

By default, if you enable this option, the firewall applies user mapping information to the traffic of all subnetworks in the zone.
To limit the information to specific subnetworks within the zone, use the `include_list` and `exclude_list`.

Note: User-ID performs discovery for the zone only if it falls within the network range that User-ID monitors.
If the zone is outside that range, the firewall does not apply user mapping information to the zone traffic even if  `enable_user_identification` is seelcted.

##### `enable_packet_buffer_protection`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

If you have configured Packet Buffer Protection on the device, enable this option to apply the packet buffer protection settings to this zone. Packet buffer protection is applied to the ingress zone only.

Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 8.1.0.

##### `nsx_service_profile`

Data type: `Optional[Boolean]`

Specify if the zone should have a nsx service profile. Note: can only be set on PAN-OS version 7.1.0.

##### `include_list`

Data type: `Optional[Array[String]]`

By default, if you do not specify subnetworks in this list, the firewall applies the user mapping information it discovers to all the traffic of this zone for use in logs, reports, and policies.

To limit the application of user mapping information to specific subnetworks within the zone, then for each subnetwork click Add and select an address (or address group) object or type the IP address range (for example, 10.1.1.1/24).
The exclusion of all other subnetworks is implicit: you do not need to add them to the `exclude_list`.

Add entries to the `exclude_list` only to exclude user mapping information for a subset of the subnetworks in the `include_list`. For example, if you add 10.0.0.0/8 to the Include List and add 10.2.50.0/22 to the `exclude_list`,
the firewall includes user mapping information for all the zone subnetworks of 10.0.0.0/8 except 10.2.50.0/22, and excludes information for all zone subnetworks outside of 10.0.0.0/8.
Note that you can only include subnetworks that fall within the network range that User-ID monitors.

##### `exclude_list`

Data type: `Optional[Array[String]]`

To exclude user mapping information for a subset of the subnetworks in the `include_list`, for each subnetwork to exclude, specify an address (or address group) or type the IP address range.

Note: If you add entries to the Exclude List but not the Include List, the firewall excludes user mapping information for all subnetworks within the zone, not just the subnetworks you added.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `panos_zone` type.

##### `name`

namevar

Data type: `Pattern[/^[a-zA-z0-9\-\s_\.]{1,31}$/]`
_*this data type contains a regex that may not be accurately reflected in generated documentation_

The display-name of the zone.
